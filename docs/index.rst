   contain the root `toctree` directive.

RedSample
=========

RedSample aims at trying to make sample management using the the popular 
`Redmine project management software <https://www.redmine.org>`_.

The idea is to try and keep all samples within a single project inside of a Redmine
instance. Each sample being represented as an Issue within redmine.

Since Redmine is highly configurable in that you can easily create custom fields
for almost any resource it makes it a comfy home to put your sample data.

RedSample utilizes the very useful `python-redmine <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-redmine>`_ 
project and thus most functionality you find in python-redmine should work with 
RedSample.
