Configuration
=============

Configuration is based on your redmine api key as well as a few other variables all
within your local .redsample.config inside your home directory.

redsample.config
================

The redsample.config is simply a yaml formatted file.
There is an example file you can copy to your home directory as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    cp redsample.config.example ~/.redsample.config

Then you can edit that file and change the variables to reflect your setup
